\subsection{Setting up the Simulation}

Although it is theoretically possible
to evolve the system through direct
integration of the schrodinger equation

TODO-WHY NOT SCHRODINGER

The

\subsection{Fixing the energy of electrons}

To ensure the correct distribution of electrons
within the simulation we also need to.

TODO- plot of electron energies at various occupation

Full code is available in the appendix TODO-

\subsection{Adding in the energy of the hydrogen}

. Since tunnelling occurs between sates which are
degenerate in energy \ldots we don't see any tunnelling


\ldots We will only see scattering between
states separated by at most \ldots

\subsection{Multi Band Approach}
To resolve both these issues we instead simulate a system
taking the basis of electrons placed in two bands.

\ldots lowers the Temperature of the electrons within
the hcp states. THis means that no net tunnelling is seen
TODO- fermi distribution
TODO- tunnelling curve
..It is therefore impossible to measure a tunnelling
rate.

\subsection{Degenerate Correction Approach}
The Approach used to simulate the system is as follows
