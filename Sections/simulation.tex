\subsection{Eigenvalue Decomposition}
The dynamics of the electron-hydrogen
system discussed in \cref{sec:the model}
can be investigated by
directly simulating the system.
This can be done through direct
integration of the
Schrödinger equation, however
if we decompose
the initial state
into eigenstates
of the complete hamiltonian\cite{conduit}
\begin{align}
    \ket{\Psi(t)} = \exp{(-i\frac{Ht}{\hbar})} \sum_n C_n \ket{n} \\
    = \sum_n C_n \exp{(-i\frac{E_n t}{\hbar})} \ket{n}
\end{align}
we can propagate
by multiplying each eigenstate
by a phase-factor.

Since we are dealing with a
large number of eigenstates
it is important to think
about both the storage
and computational complexity
of the two methods (\cref{tab:algorithm complexity}).
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ *{3}{c} }
            \toprule
            Cost    & Integration            & Decomposition              \\
            \midrule
            Time    & \(\mathcal{O}(n^2 t)\) & \(\mathcal{O}(n^3 + n d)\) \\
            Storage & \(\mathcal{O}(n d)\)   & \(\mathcal{O}(n^2 + n d)\) \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Complexity associated with the
        two methods of solving Schrödinger equation,
        for \(n\) eigenstates, \(t\)
        timesteps and \(d\) datapoints. The method
        of eigenvalue decomposition
        prevents the \(\mathcal{O}(t)\)
        dependence seen
        in direct integration
        by first decomposing the
        eigenstate (\(\mathcal{O}(n^3)\))
        before multiplying
        by the relevant phase
        (\(\mathcal{O}(nd)\)).
    }\label{tab:algorithm complexity}
\end{table}

As we
are only interested in the
evolution of the eigenstates
at times much greater than
the frequency
\(\omega = \frac{E}{\hbar}\)
integration
was found to be much
slower than eigenvalue
decomposition. One
issue is the increased storage
cost associated with storing
the complete
hamiltonian. This could
be prevented by
working with a sparse
matrix, however in
practise this
was not required.

Although the decomposition is
expensive it was only repeated once,
allowing us to gather a large
number of times at very little additional
cost. It was also possible to use the
fact that the matrix was hermitian to
provide and additional increase in speed.

\subsection{Matrix Representation}\label{sec:state representation}
Working in the unperturbed electron basis
(\cref{sec:electron states})
we label each eigenstate
according to the index of the
hydrogen site and
the configuration of the
electron system.
For \(n\)
electron states
and \(m\) hydrogen states
there are \(m 2^n\) eigenstates,
however we work with a fixed
number of electrons \(N\)
such that the number
of states scales as \(m \times{} \binom{n}{N}\).
In practise we were able to
simulate a system with
\(\sim 3500\) eigenstates,
or \(14\) half filled electron states
(\cref{tab:number of eigenstates}).
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ *{4}{c} }
            \toprule
            Number of States & All Configurations & Half Filled & 2 electrons \\
            \midrule
            \(10\)           & \(1024\)           & \(252\)     & \(45\)      \\

            \(16\)           & \(65536\)          & \(12870\)   & \(120\)     \\

        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{
        Number of eigenstates in the electron-hydrogen
        system. We were able to simulate a larger

        This method scales particularly
        well for a system with a
        low number of electrons.
    }\label{tab:number of eigenstates}
\end{table}
Exchange statistics are
important when working with
fermions.
For self consistency we work in
a basis such that electrons
with lower energy are always
added first. Terms in the
hamiltonian pick
up a minus sign when there is
an odd number of exchanges.
\begin{align}
    a^\dagger_1a_2 \ket{2,3} & = \ket{1,3}  \\
    a^\dagger_1a_3 \ket{2,3} & = -\ket{1,2}
\end{align}

\subsection{Choosing the Initial States}

\subsubsection{Distribution Of Energies}
The electron energies were
initially evenly spaced however
this lead to rabi oscillations
at a fixed frequency.
To allow for cancellation
of the noise a
random offset was introduced
into the energy distribution
which changed the rabi frequencies
between each run.

The electron energy spacing
also sets the effective volume of the nickel
lattice. The density of states of a free electron
gas \(g(E)\) is given by~\cite{KittelCharles1953Itss}
\begin{equation}
    g(E) = \frac{V}{2\pi^2}
    {(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2})}^{\frac{3}{2}}
    E^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
We invert this expression
to find the implied volume
\begin{equation}
    V = 2\pi^2
    \frac{g(E)}{E^{\frac{1}{2}}}
    {(\frac{\hbar^2}{2m})}^{\frac{3}{2}}
\end{equation}
At large \(k\) we find
\(g(E)\) is roughly
constant so we make the approximation
\begin{equation}
    g(E) = \frac{dN}{dE} \sim \frac{1}{E_{space}}
\end{equation}
where \(E_{space}\) is the energy spacing
of the simulation. From \cref{eqn:simplified interacton potential} we find
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_{int} \propto \frac{1}{V} \propto E_{space}
    \label{eqn:energy spacing dependance of interaction hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
for smaller
energy spacing we have
a larger volume, and a smaller
perturbation.

\subsubsection{Distribution Of Electrons}
To average over successive
simulations we setup the
simulation with a random
choice of initial states.
We can start the hydrogen
in the FCC site by setting the
amplitudes of the HCP sites to zero
before choosing the FCC aptitudes according to
a normal distribution.

For a real system at a fixed
temperature the electron occupation
should follow the fermi-dirac distribution.
To match this distribution we
set the average amplitude of
each state \(C_k\) to the
square-root of the boltzmann probability \(P_k\).
\begin{align}
    P_k & = \exp(-\beta{}E_k)     \\
    C_k & = \exp(-\beta{}E_k / 2)
\end{align}
Plotting the
electron occupation for fixed \(N\)
we recover the fermi-dirac
distribution (\cref{fig:correct fermi dirac}).

        deviation of the electron densities, and are
        therefore larger around the fermi surface where fluctuations are
        large.}\label{fig:correct fermi dirac}
\end{figure}
If we were to include
a large interaction term, such
as those required for the
real nickel system the
fermi-dirac distribution
is no longer seen as this approach
does not account for the
shift in the perturbed
energies (\cref{fig:incorrect fermi dirac}).

        (\cref{sub@fig:reduced interaction fermi-dirac}).
    }\label{fig:incorrect fermi dirac}
\end{figure}
To overcome this limitation
the simulation was repeated
for small energy bands (\cref{sec:small band approach})
for which the electron distribution
was uniform.

\subsection{Initial Investigation}
To estimate the tunneling
rate the system was setup
with electrons evenly spaced
in \(E_k = E_f \pm 2k_b T\).
The hydrogen occupation
could then be inferred by
summing the occupation
of electrons in both the FCC and
HCP sites. The size of
the interaction (\(6.21\times{}10^{-21}J\) diagonal,
\(2.73\times{}10^{-23}J\) off diagonal) was
similar to the separation of electron energies
(\(9.2\times{}10^{-22}J\)),
and as such the approximation required
for a fermi-dirac distribution did not
hold. For degenerate hydrogen energies
(\cref{fig:tunnelling rate single large band})
we see tunneling in \(10^{-9}s\) however
once the hydrogen energy was included
we no longer see any tunneling
(\cref{fig:issues with single large band}).

        at much larger timescales. Even without the
        inclusion of hydrogen energies
        the incorrect electron distribution is
        seen (\cref{fig:large band fermi-dirac}).
    }\label{fig:issues with single large band}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Small Band Approach}\label{sec:small band approach}
To limit the effect of the incorrect
fermi distribution we
take electrons with a similar
occupation localised
in a small region of the fermi
surface.

One issue is that states at the edge
of the band will be `missing'
states to mix with during the
perturbation. We can approximate
this overlap using first order perturbation theory.
\begin{equation}
    \ket{n} = \ket{n^{(0)}} + \sum_{K\neq{}n} \frac{\bra{k^{(0)}} \hat{H}_{int} \ket{n^{(0)}}}{E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}} \ket{k^{(0)}}
\end{equation}
Since \(\hat{H}_{int} \propto E_{space}\)
(\cref{eqn:energy spacing dependance of interaction hamiltonian})
the overlap between neighbours does
not depend on the energy spacing. Luckily
the interaction is small
enough such that states only interact with
their closest neighbours (\cref{fig:single band energies}),
and the effect of these missing states should be small.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/Simulation/Plot of single band eigenstate energy range.png}

    \end{subfigure}

        \subcaption{Detailed view of lower energies}\label{fig:initial and final state energies of single band zoom}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Average initial state energy weighted by the
        occupation  probability. The final
        state energy is separated into
        symmetric and antisymmetric
        contributions
        (\cref{fig:initial and final state energies of single band}).
        In \cref{fig:initial and final state energies of single band zoom}
        we can see each state is highly degenerate, and mixing
        is limited to the four nearest neighbours.
    }\label{fig:single band energies}
\end{figure}
Tunneling could also be
influenced
through a combination of
several electron `hops'.
Due to the energy time uncertainty
principle \(\Delta{}E\Delta{}T \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}\)
we expect the total energy to be conserved
to within
\begin{equation}
    \Delta{}E \sim \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta{} t}
\end{equation}
so that for a tunnelling time of
\(\sim 10^{-9}s\)
we expect an energy fluctuation
of \(\sim 5\times{}10^{-26} J\).
We therefore choose states separated
by at-least \(10^{-25} J\).
Interaction with states outside
the band is then prohibited
through energy conservation.


\subsection{Different Hydrogen Energy}\label{sec:different hydrogen energy}
If we add the hydrogen energies to the
simulation we no longer see tunnelling
on any timescale. Repeating the analysis
in \cref{sec:small band approach} we
see that eigenstate mixing
is dominated by
eigenstates degenerate in energy.
In the initial approach we
miss much of the overlap which could
contribute to tunnelling. To ensure that we always have
states degenerate in energy we
introduce two electron
bands separated by the hydrogen energy
difference.

    \centering

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Plot of eigenstate energies
        against the FCC `occupation-fraction'
        For a single band we
        see very little overlap between the FCC and HCP
        states (\cref{fig:one band overlap})
        as the energies are poorly matched.
        Introducing two bands separated by the hydrogen energy
        difference (\cref{fig:two band overlap})
        we find mixing between states which are
        degenerate in energy
    }\label{fig:overlap with hydrogen energies}
\end{figure}
With this approach
we find the final-state
energies are split into three
bands which are separated
into distinct groups. To
promote mixing between these
each group we increase the width
of each band, however different mixing
within each band leads to a
reduction in the overlap.
To prevent this
we simply remove the diagonal
interaction, however in (\cref{sec:tunnelling no diagonal})
we find this changes the
measured tunneling rate.
Given the rate scales as
\(N(1-N')\) it is possible to
calculate a theoretical equilibrium,
however it does not tend to this value
even when
working with a small band.

        \cref{fig:two band minimum mixing}
        demonstrates the issue with
        using a large band; the diagonal
        interaction causes mixing within
        groups of eigenstates which
        lifts the degeneracy required for
        the off diagonal interaction.
        This can be fixed by removing
        the diagonal interaction
        (\cref{fig:two band no diagonal})
        however in
        \cref{sec:tunnelling no diagonal}
        we find this is
        necessary for the correct
        tunneling behaviour.

        behaviour is not seen

        should be used to model
        the true

    }\label{fig:issue with two band approach}
\end{figure}
We do however see a reduction in
fluctuations if the system is initially
prepared with this occupation
(\cref{fig:two band close to equilibrium}).
We also find material cools
during the tunneling process
as energy is transferred
from the electron gas to the hydrogen
(\cref{fig:two band temperature shift}).
The temperature
shift can be reduced by adding
more electrons to the
simulation.
