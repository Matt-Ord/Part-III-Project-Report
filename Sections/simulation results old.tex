\section{Old Simulation Section}

THIS IS THE OLD STUFF


The curve was initially fitted to
\begin{equation}
    R(N, N) = \frac{2R_0}{\cosh{(B(N - 0.5))}}
\end{equation}
with both the initial and final occupancy
equal to N. \ldots however although the rate is small it
would not fall to zero as \(N \rightarrow 0\).
Since we expect the rate to be proportional to the
number of electrons we add a prefactor of \(N(N-1)\)
to the expression, giving us
\begin{equation}
    R = \frac{2 N(N-1) R_0}{\cosh{(B(N - 0.5))}}
\end{equation}
To see the effect of this factor
states with only
one electron or one hole must be included.
In this
case the previous
oscillatory behaviour is replaced
by a more steady decay, which was fitted to
\(\exp{(-at^2)}\). TODO-justify in figure Due to this new
method of fitting the data the
single particle rates appeared
offset from the rest of the data,
however their rates were consistent
with the \(N(N-1)\) factor TODO-fig.

Although this has \ldots little effect in exp \ldots
when plotting \(\ln{R}\) against \(N\) we can see a
clear reduction in the rate, consistent with this factor
at lower occupations.

TODO-plot, fill out missing \ldots.

The degenerate tunnelling rates

\subsection{Non Degenerate Tunnelling}
To recover the tunnelling rate for hydrogen of different
energy we need to transform the rate equation
into the form

Due to the arguments outlined in
\cref{app:combined tunnelling rates}
a general system with two tunnelling
rates has a combined rate
\begin{equation}
    R_{tot}(N\rightarrow{}N') = R(N\rightarrow{}N') + R_{tot}(N'\rightarrow{}N)
\end{equation}
therefore any guess at the corrected rate
must be written in this form, where the
behaviour of \(R(N\rightarrow{}N')\)
should match up with \(0.5 R_{tot}(N\rightarrow{}N)\)
at \(N' = N\). The four simplest
ways to transform the rate are
\begin{align}
    R(N\rightarrow{}N') & = \frac{N(N-1) R_0}{\cosh{(B(N - 0.5))}}               \\
    R(N\rightarrow{}N') & = \frac{N(N'-1) R_0}{\cosh{(B(N - 0.5))}}              \\
    R(N\rightarrow{}N') & = \frac{N(N-1) R_0}{\cosh{(\frac{B}{2}(N + N' - 1))}}  \\
    R(N\rightarrow{}N') & = \frac{N(N'-1) R_0}{\cosh{(\frac{B}{2}(N + N' - 1))}}
    \label{eqn:double corrected rate expression}
\end{align}
TODO-Reword
where the \(N(N'-1)\) prefactor is interpreted
as the number of initial electrons multiplied
by the number of final state holes, and
\( N + N' - 1 \) is interpreted as
\(N\) electrons minus \(1 -N' \) holes
since the holes flow in the backwards direction.
If we plot the four corrected rate curves
we can eliminate (eq \ldots to \ldots) if we
require the rate to peak at  \ldots

\subsection{Temperature Dependance}
The correction should also be well behaved
at all temperatures. As we reduce the
temperature the hydrogen
energy becomes much greater than the
range of electrons exited above the fermi
surface, and we therefore expect the tunnelling
rate to be `frozen out' as \(T\rightarrow{}0\).
This behaviour is not seen in eqn \ldots
where backwards rate begins to
dominate.

Two other possible forms for the
tunnelling rate were suggested
\begin{align}
    R(N\rightarrow{}N') & = \frac{\sqrt{N(N-1)N'(N'-1)} R_0}{\cosh{(B(N - 0.5))}}                             \\
    R(N\rightarrow{}N') & = \frac{4N(N-1)N'(N'-1) R_0}{\cosh{(B(N - 0.5))}}\label{eqn:two hop corrected rate}
\end{align}
Both of these could be justified by considering
the rate as composed of two processes ---
tunnelling followed by reorganisation of
the electron gas. The tunnelling rate
would therefore depend on \(N_{i}(1-N_{f})\)
for both processes.

Ultimately however we see very little
difference effect
on the tunnelling rate
at \(150K\) if we impose the
correct limit as \(N' \rightarrow N\) TODO-Plot
and there is no evidence that the
rate should not diverge at low temperatures.
\ldots we therefore stick with
\cref{eqn:double corrected rate expression}

\subsection{Corrected Results}
Overall we see the corrected results
have very little
