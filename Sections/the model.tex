\subsection{}
To calculate the tunnelling rate we
need to build a model of the Electron-Hydrogen
interaction. This system is completely
described by it's hamiltonian, which can be
split into free and interaction energy
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_{free} + \hat{H}_{int}
\end{equation}
where the free hamiltonian \(\hat{H}_{free}\)
can be separated
into an electron and hydrogen component
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_{free} =
    \hat{H}_{e^-} + \hat{H}_{h}\\
\end{equation}



\subsection{Electron States}\label{sec:electron states}
For the purpose of this model we ignore the
interaction between the electrons
and the lattice as well as electron-electron
interactions. This allows
us expand the free electron
hamiltonian using the plane wave
basis
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_{e^-} = \sum_{k, s}
    \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_e} \hat{b}^\dagger_{k, s} \hat{b}_{k, s}\\
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{b}^\dagger_{k, s}\)
is the electron creation operator
with spin \(s\) and wavevector
\(k\) satisfying the standard
fermion anti-commutation relations
\( \{ \hat{b}_{k, s}, \hat{b}^\dagger_{k', s'} \}
= \delta_{k k'} \delta_{s s'}\).

Taking the lattice constant of Nickel as
\(3.499\pm{}0.005\times{}10^{-10}m\)~\cite{PhysRev.25.753},
we find the density of Nickel as
\(9.34\times{}10^{28}m^{-3}\).
Assuming both of the 2 valence
electrons on Nickel are completely
delocalised in
the free electron gas we
find an electron density of
\(n = 1.87\times{}10^{29} m^{-3}\).
We then used this value to calculate
the fermi-wavevector and fermi-energy of
Nickel~\cite{KittelCharles1953Itss}
\begin{align}
    \epsilon_f & = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} {(3\pi^2n)}^{2/3} \\
    k_f^3      & = 3 \pi^2 n
\end{align}
which gives a value of
\begin{align}
    \epsilon_f & = 1.91\times{}10^{-18}J                                  \\
    k_f        & = 1.77\times{}10^{10}m^{-1} \label{eqn:fermi wavevector}
\end{align}
From measurements of the optical
properties of Nickel the
fermi energy is found to
be slightly lower
at only
\(1.24\times{} 10^{-18}J\)~\cite{PhysRev.131.2469}.

\subsection{Hydrogen States}
The hydrogen states produced
taking into account interaction with
the \(Ni\) lattice, with the form
of the wavefunctions taken
from previous DFT calculations. TODO-CITE

These calculations gave hydrogen
states localised at two positions
within the material, at a lower energy
`FCC' site and a higher energy
`HCP' site. We consider two neighbouring
sites, and expand the hydrogen
hamiltonian in this basis
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_{h} =
    E_0 \hat{a}^\dagger_0 \hat{a}_0
    + E_1 \hat{a}^\dagger_1 \hat{a}_1
\end{equation}
where \(0\) denotes the FCC site and \(1\)
denotes the HCP site,
with \(\hat{a}^\dagger_i\) the hydrogen creation
operator for the site i
which satisfies the standard commutation
relations for a boson
\(\left[ \hat{a}_i, \hat{a}^\dagger_j \right]
= \delta_{ij}\).

Although the DFT calculation
also provides a theoretical calculation
of the hydrogen energies, the
energy used in the
model were
taken from direct spin-echo measurements~\cite{Jianding-Zhu}.
These measurements gave a value of
\begin{equation}
    \Delta{}E_{hyd} = E_1 - E_0
    = 3.04\pm0.16\times{}10^{-21} J
    \label{eqn:hydrogen energy difference}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Electron Hydrogen Interaction}
The electron hydrogen interaction can
be described simply by introducing
the electron and hydrogen field
operators \(\hat{\psi}_e\) and
\(\hat{\psi}_h\)~\cite{nazarov_danon_2013}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_{int} = \int\int{d\vec{r} d\vec{r}'
        V(\vec{r}-\vec{r}')
        \hat{\psi}^\dagger_h(\vec{r})
        \hat{\psi}^\dagger_e(\vec{r'})
        \hat{\psi}_e(\vec{r'})
        \hat{\psi}_h(\vec{r})}
\end{equation}
where \(V(\vec{r})\) is
the electron-hydrogen
interaction potential.
We first expand out the
electron operator in
the free electron basis state
\begin{align}
    \hat{\psi}_e(\vec{r}) & = \sum_{k, s}
    \braket{\vec{r}|\vec{k}}
    \hat{b}_{k, s}                                      \\
                          & = \frac{1}{L^{\frac{3}{2}}}
    \sum_{k, s} \exp{(i\vec{k}.\vec{r})}
    \hat{b}_{k, s}
\end{align}
to give us the expression
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_{int} & =
    \sum_{k, s, k', s'} \int\int{\frac{d\vec{r} d\vec{r}'}{L^3}
        V(\vec{r}-\vec{r}')
        \hat{b}^\dagger_{k',s'}
        \hat{b}_{k, s}
        \exp{(i(\vec{k} - \vec{k'}).\vec{r'})}
        \hat{\psi}^\dagger_h(\vec{r})
    \hat{\psi}_h(\vec{r})}                       \\
                  & = \begin{aligned}[t]
        \frac{1}{L^3}
        \sum_{k, s, k', s'}
         & \int d(\vec{r}' - \vec{r})
        V(\vec{r}-\vec{r}')
        \hat{b}^\dagger_{k',s'}
        \hat{b}_{k, s}
        \exp{(i(\vec{k} - \vec{k'}).(\vec{r'} - \vec{r}))} \\
         & \int d\vec{r}
        \exp{(i(\vec{k} - \vec{k'}).\vec{r})}
        \hat{\psi}^\dagger_h(\vec{r})
        \hat{\psi}_h(\vec{r})
    \end{aligned} \\
    \hat{H}_{int} & = \frac{1}{L^3}
    \sum_{k,s,k',s'}
    \hat{b}^\dagger_{k',s'}\hat{b}_{k,s}
    \tilde{V}(\vec{q})\int{d\vec{r}
    \hat{\psi}_h^{\dagger}\hat{\psi}_h
    \exp(i\vec{q}.\vec{r})}
\end{align}
where \(\vec{q} = \vec{k} - \vec{k'}\)
is the scattering wavevector, and
\(\tilde{V}(\vec{q})\) is the
fourier transform of the interaction
potential.


\subsection{The Electron Hydrogen Potential}

The electrons surrounding the hydrogen
atom have energies
\(E_n = -\frac{13.6}{n^2} eV\)~\cite{griffiths_schroeter_2018}.
Since the energy required to excite the electron
to the \(n=2\) energy level is much greater
than the fermi energy of \(Ni\)
(\(7.76eV\)~\cite{PhysRev.131.2469}) we can
make the approximation that the electron surrounding
the hydrogen lie close to the 1s groundstate.

The potential is then given by the equation TODO-CITE
\begin{equation}
    V(\vec{r}) = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}(
    -\frac{1}{r}
    + \int{\frac{\abs{\phi(\vec{r}')}^2}{
            \abs{\vec{r} - \vec{r'}}} d\vec{r}'})
\end{equation}
where \(a_0\) is
the bohr radius and
\begin{equation}
    \phi(\vec{r}) = {(\pi a_0^3)}^{-1/2} e^{-\frac{r}{a_0}}
\end{equation}
is the 1s hydrogen orbital~\cite{griffiths_schroeter_2018}.
We then fourier
transform this expression
(see \cref{app:interaction potential calculation})
to find
\begin{eqnarray}
    V(\vec{q}) &=& \frac{e^2}{\epsilon_0 q^2}(
    \frac{\alpha^4}{{(\alpha^2 + q^2)}^2} - 1
    )
\end{eqnarray}
with \(\alpha = \frac{2}{a_0}\). If we expand
about \(q=0\) we find
\begin{eqnarray}
    V(q) &\sim&\frac{e^2}{\epsilon_0 q^2}(1 - 2{(\frac{q}{\alpha})}^2 + 3 {(\frac{q}{\alpha})}^4 - 1)\\
    {} &=& -\frac{2e^2}{\epsilon_0 \alpha^2}(1 - \frac{3}{2}{(\frac{q}{\alpha})}^2) + \mathcal{O}(q^4)
\end{eqnarray}
taking \(q = k_f = 1.77\times{}10^{10}m^{-1}\)
(see \cref{sec:electron states})
and \(\alpha = 3.79\times{}10^{10}\) we see the second
order correction only contributes to a variation
of around \(14.5\% \).
We therefore assume that for the relevant scattering
of electrons the potential takes a constant
value \(V(q) \sim -\frac{2e^2}{\epsilon_0 \alpha^2}\).

\subsection{The Hydrogen Wavefunction}
TODO-
The form of the hydrogen wavefunctions were
known from previous \ldots DFT Calculations from Jianding's thesis \ldots


\ldots using these

The wavefunctions provided by this software however
were expressed in terms of bloch wavefunctions spread
through the whole material.
To recover a localised
wavepacket several of these states were chosen
centered about \(q=0\).
TODO-HOW
Given these wavefunctions
it was then possible to calculate the fourier
transform products directly. As there was a fixed
distance between the FCC and HCP lattice
sites however the fourier transform was seen to
oscillate (\cref{fig:fourier transform oscillation}), with a frequency proportional to
\(\frac{2\pi}{a}\) where \(a\) is the lattice
constant of \(Ni\). The value of this constant
is around \(3.499\pm{}0.005\times{}10^{-10}m\)~\cite{PhysRev.25.753}
corresponding to oscillations at
\(q = 1.79 \pm 0.03 \times{}10^{10}m^{-1}\).

    \caption{Results of the hydrogen fourier transform calculations.
    FCC-FCC and HCP-HCP calculations
    (\cref{fig:diagonal hydrogen matrix element no oscillation})
    show a smooth curve, with a normalised
    value of one at \(q=0\).
    The FCC-HCP fourier transform
    (\cref{fig:cross hydrogen matrix element oscillation})
    however show oscillations with a characteristic
    wavevector \(q = 1.79 \pm 0.03 \times{}10^{10}m^{-1}\),
    corresponding to the lattice vector of \(Ni\).}\label{fig:fourier transform oscillation}
\end{figure}
In theory this should have a noticeable
effect on the matrix element, with a
fermi wavevector of
\(1.177\times{}10^{10} m^{-1}\)~\cref{eqn:fermi wavevector},
however since the overall wavepacket decays over a region
of around \(\frac{100\pi}{a}\) we should be
able to average over the rapid oscillations of
\(V(\vec{q})\) to obtain an effective constant
potential required for the simulation. For this
model we therefore simply take the maximum overlap
of the normalised wavefunction (\cref{tab:hydrogen overlaps}).
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ *{3}{c} }
            \toprule
            Overlap & Maximum Overlap        & Normalised Overlap     \\
            \midrule
            FCC-FCC & \(3.00\times{}10^{7}\) & \(1\)                  \\
            HCP-HCP & \(3.00\times{}10^{7}\) & \(1\)                  \\
            HCP-FCC & \(1.33\times{}10^{5}\) & \(4.4\times{}10^{-3}\) \\
            \bottomrule

    \caption{Normalised Hydrogen overlaps as used in the
        model. Fluctuations in the overlap
        integral are ignored. The maximum

        has a minimum at this point.}\label{tab:hydrogen overlaps}
\end{table}

\subsection{Simplified Electron-Hydrogen Interaction
}\label{sec:simplified interaction}
For simplicity, in the following sections
we gather the constant terms into
an effective potential.
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_{int} = \sum_{k,s,k',s',i,j}
    {\tilde{V}(\vec{q})}_{i,j}
    \hat{b}^\dagger_{k',s'}\hat{b}_{k,s}
    \hat{a}^\dagger_{i}\hat{a}_{j}
    \label{eqn:interaction hamiltonian in k}
\end{equation}
If we take the potential to be independent
of \(q\) we can separate it
into a constant prefactor
and hydrogen overlap factors
\begin{align}
    V_{i,j}
     & =
    \frac{1}{L^3}
    \mathcal{C}_{i,j}
    \frac{2e^2}{\epsilon_0 \alpha^2} \\
     & =
    \frac{1}{L^3}
    \mathcal{C}_{i,j}
    \frac{8 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 \hbar^4}{e^2 m^2}
    \label{eqn:simplified interacton potential}
\end{align}
where \(\mathcal{C}\) takes
the value
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{C}_{i, i}      & = 1      \\
    \mathcal{C}_{i, \neq i} & = 0.0044
\end{align}

It is often beneficial to separate
\cref{eqn:interaction hamiltonian in k}
into a system and environment contribution.
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_{int} & =
    \sum_{i,j}
    \hat{a}^\dagger_{i}\hat{a}_{j}
    \sum_{k,s,k',s'}
    \tilde{V}_{i,j}
    \hat{b}^\dagger_{k',s'}\hat{b}_{k,s} \\
                  & = \sum_{i,j}
    \hat{S}_{i,j} \hat{E}_{i,j}\label{eqn:split interaction hamiltonian}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    \hat{S}_{i,j} & = \hat{a}^\dagger_{i}\hat{a}_{j} \\
    \hat{E}_{i,j} & = \sum_{k,s,k',s'}
    \tilde{V}_{i,j}
    \hat{b}^\dagger_{k',s'}\hat{b}_{k,s}
\end{align}
