\subsection{Q dependance}
TODO-
For the purpose of the simulation
it was necessary to assume a q independent
matrix element, \ldots to have a decent number of states \ldots
\ldots half interaction to give effective average

In the future it may also be possible to
directly investigate the effect
of q dependance in a much simpler system
with only one or two separate electron
energy states.
It would then be possible to select
several electron states randomly distributed
around a sphere of k states, and from
this an effective potential could be calculated.

TODO- calculate tunnelling rate if half the
interaction potential.
