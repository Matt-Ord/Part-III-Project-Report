\subsection{Q dependance}
TODO-
For the purpose of the simulation
it was necessary to assume a q independent
matrix element, \ldots to have a decent number of states \ldots
\ldots half interaction to give effective average

In the future it may also be possible to
directly investigate the effect
of q dependance in a much simpler system
with only one or two separate electron
energy states.
It would then be possible to select
several electron states randomly distributed
around a sphere of k states, and from
this an effective potential could be calculated.

TODO- calculate tunnelling rate if half the
interaction potential.

TODO- Sparse matrix
TODO- Properly vectorise

\subsection{Multiple Hydrogen Sites}
In the real Nickel lattice the FCC and
HCP sites are arranged in a regular
lattice, such that there are \ldots
neighbouring HCP site of each FCC
hydrogen. In future investigations
it should be therefore be
possible to include the
effect of a larger number of
hydrogen sites,

however
it is unclear how best to
incorporate `hopping' behaviour
of the hydrogen--- in the real
experiment the hydrogen becomes
localised onto a specific site
at later times. An effect we will
fail to see in any \ldots integration of
the schrodinger equation.
