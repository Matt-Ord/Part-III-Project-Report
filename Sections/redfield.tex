\subsection{General Equation of Motion}
\ldots is to describe the system as a density
matrix \ldots
Working in the interaction
picture, a general density operator
\(\hat{\rho}(t)\) time evolves according
to the von Neumann equation~\cite{TP2_Notes}.
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\hat{\rho}_t(t)}{dt} =
  -i [\hat{H}_{int}(t), \hat{\rho}_t(t)]
  \label{eqn:density equation of motion}
\end{equation}
which can be integrated to give
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_t(t) =
  \hat{\rho}_t(0)
  - i \int_0^t ds
    [\hat{H}_{int}(s), \hat{\rho}_t(s)]
  \label{eqn:integrated density equation of motion}
\end{equation}
we then expand the equation of motion
to second order in the interaction
by substituting \cref{eqn:integrated density equation of motion}
into \cref{eqn:density equation of motion}
twice to give
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\hat{\rho}_t(t)}{dt} =
  -i [\hat{H}_{int}(t), \hat{\rho}_t(0)]
  - \int_0^t ds
    [\hat{H}_{int}(s),
      [\hat{H}_{int}(s), \hat{\rho}_t(t)]]
  +\mathcal{O}({\hat{H}_{int}}^3)
\end{equation}
To find an equation of motion
including just the system we then take
the trace over the environment,
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}(t) =
  -i Tr_e[\hat{H}_{int}(t), \hat{\rho}_t(0)]
  - \int_0^t ds
  Tr_e[\hat{H}_{int}(s),
  [\hat{H}_{int}(s), \hat{\rho}_t(t)]]
  \label{eqn:density motion before redfield approximation}
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{\rho}(t) = Tr_e[\hat{\rho}_t(t)]\)
is the density operator of the system.
Using a clever re-definition of the interaction
Hamiltonian~\cite{Manzano_2020} it
is possible to show that the first
term gives no contribution to the
overall dynamics of the system.

\subsection{The Redfield Assumption}\label{sec:the redfield assumption}
To arrive at the Redfield equation
we make the assumption that the
system and surrounding density
matrix is completely decoupled,
allowing us to write
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_t(t) = \hat{\rho}(t) \otimes \hat{\rho}_E(t)
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{\rho}_E(t)\), the
density matrix of the environment,
is taken as a purely statistical ensemble.
By extending the upper limit
of \cref{eqn:density motion before redfield approximation}
to \(\infty \) we arrive at the Redfield
equation
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\hat{\rho}}(t) =
  - \int_0^{\infty} ds
  Tr_{E}[\hat{H}_{int}(t),
      [\hat{H}_{int}(s-t),
          \hat{\rho}(t) \otimes \hat{\rho}_E(t)]]
\end{equation}
Separating out the interaction hamiltonian
into system and surroundings according
to~\cref{eqn:split interaction hamiltonian}
\begin{align}
  \hat{H}_{int} & = \sum_{i,j} \hat{S}_{i,j} \hat{E}_{i,j}
\end{align}
we can simplify the form of this equation~\cite{Manzano_2020} to give
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\hat{\rho{}}}(t) = \begin{aligned}[t]
    \sum_{i,j,k, l} &
    \exp{(-i(\omega_{i,j}-\omega_{k,l})t)}
    \Gamma_{i,j;k, l}(\omega_{k,l})
    [S_{k, l}\hat{\rho}(t),
    S^\dagger_{i,j}]  \\
    +               &
    \exp{(i(\omega_{i,j}-\omega_{k,l}))}
    \Gamma^*_{k, l; i,j}(\omega_{i,j})
    [S_{k, l},
      \hat{\rho}(t) S^\dagger_{i,j}]
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where \(\Gamma \) is given by
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{i,j, k,l}(\omega) =
  \int_0^\infty{}{
  ds \exp{(i\omega{}s)}
  Tr_{E}[E^\dagger_{i,j}(t)E_{k,l}(t-s)\rho_E(0)]
  }\label{eqn:gamma definition}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Further Simplifications}


\subsection{Calculating \(\Gamma \)}
Using expression \cref{eqn:gamma definition}
we can calculate the value of \(\Gamma \).
The
density matrix of a purely
statistical ensemble is given
by~\cite{sakurai_napolitano_2020}
\begin{equation}
  \rho_E(0) = \sum_{\{N(k)\}}
  P(\{N(k)\})
  \ket{N(k)} \bra{N(k)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \hat{E}_{i,j} = \sum_{k,s,k',s'}
  {\tilde{V}_{eff}(\vec{q})}_{i,j}
  \hat{b}^\dagger_{k',s'}\hat{b}_{k,s}
\end{equation}
where we assume the potential
is independent of \(q\). We can
take the trace over the
environment (todo reference)
\begin{equation}
  Tr_E[\dots]  = \begin{aligned}[t]
    \sum_{\substack{\{N(k)\}                             \\
    k_1,s^1,k_2,s^2                                      \\
        k_3,s^3,k_4,s^4 }}
     & P(\{N(k)\}) V_{i,j} V_{k,l}                       \\
     & \exp{(i(E_1 - E_2) t)} \exp{(i(E_3 - E_4) (t-s))} \\
     & \bra{N(k)}
    \hat{b}_{k_1,s^1}^\dagger{} \hat{b}_{k_2,s^2}
    \hat{b}_{k_3,s^3}^\dagger{} \hat{b}_{k_4,s^4}
    \ket{N(k)}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where \( \{N(k)\} \) is the set of
all possible occupations, and
the boltzmann
probability associated with a
given state is
\(P(\{N(k)\}) = \exp{(-\beta{}(E-\mu N))}\).
The trace is only non zero in two
cases
\begin{itemize}
  \item \(k_1=k_2, s^1=s^2\),
        \(k_3=k_4, s^3=s^4\)
  \item \(k_1=k_4, s^1=s^4\),
        \(k_3=k_2, s^3=s^2\) but
        \(k_1\neq{}k_2, s^1\neq{}s^2\)
\end{itemize}
and we can therefore obtain the
simplified form of the trace
\begin{equation}
  Tr_E[\dots] = \begin{aligned}[t]
    \sum_{k_1,s^1,k_3,s^3 }
     & V_{i,j} V_{k,l} [ \\
     & N_1 N_3
        + N_1 (1 - N_3) \exp{(-i(E_3 - E_1)s)}]
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Integrating over \(s\) we obtain
an additional constant on the
wavevectors, and after
converting the sum into
an integral and re-adsorbing
the power of \(L^3\) into the
definition of (reference)
\begin{align}
  \Gamma_{i,j, k,l}(\omega) & =\begin{aligned}[t]
    \sum_{s^1,s^3} \int &
    \frac{d^3\vec{k}_1}{{(2\pi)}^3}
    \frac{d^3\vec{k}_3}{{(2\pi)}^3}
    V_{i,j} V_{k,l} [
    N_1 N_3 \delta_{w, 0} \frac{m}{\sqrt{k_3^2}} \\
                        & + N_1 (1 - N_3)
        \frac{m}{\sqrt{k_1^2 - 2m\omega}}
        \delta({k_3 \pm \sqrt{k_1^2 + 2m\omega}}) ]
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
The first term is divergent (reference)
but we find no terms in the \ldots
with \(\omega = 0\).
We evaluate the second term
by expanding about the fermi
wavevector
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{i,j, k,l}(\omega_{k,l}) =\begin{aligned}[t]
    \sum_{s^1,s^3} \exp{(\frac{\beta \omega_{k,l}}{2})} \frac{m k_f^2 }{{(2\pi)}^4}
    V_{i,j} V_{k,l} \sqrt{\pi} \frac{2m}{\beta \hbar^2}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
substituting in the expression
for v (reference)
we arrive at the final
expression for \(\Gamma \)
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{s^1,s^3} \exp{(\frac{\beta \omega_{k,l}}{2})}
  \mathcal{C}_{i,j} \mathcal{C}_{k,l}
  \sqrt{\pi} \frac{8 k_f^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^3}{\beta e^4 m^2}
\end{equation}

\section{}
we arrive at the final form of
the Lindblad equation
for our system
\begin{equation}
  \bra{m}\dot{\hat{\rho{}(t)}} \ket{m} = \begin{aligned}[t]
    [ & 2\Gamma_{m,\neq m;m, \neq m}(\omega_{m,\neq m})\rho_{\neq m, \neq m} \\
    - & 2\Gamma_{\neq m,m;\neq m, m}(\omega_{\neq m,m})\rho_{m, m}]
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{i,j, k,l}(\omega_{k,l})   =
  \exp{(\frac{\beta \omega_{k,l}}{2})}
  \mathcal{C}_{i,j} \mathcal{C}_{k,l}
  \sqrt{\pi} \frac{32 k_f^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^3}{\beta e^4 m^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Analytic Solution to the Rotating Wave Approximation}
Since the form of the rotating
wave approximation is a simple
rate equation with two variables
it is possible to solve it analytically
\cref{app:combined tunnelling rates}.
From the expression above we find the
forward and backward tunnelling rate as
\begin{align}
  \gamma_0 & = 2\Gamma_{1,0;0, 1}(\omega_{1,0})       \\
           & = A \exp{(\frac{\beta \omega_{0,1}}{2})}
  \mathcal{C}_{1,0} \mathcal{C}_{0,1}                 \\
  \gamma_1 & = 2\Gamma_{0,1;1, 0}(\omega_{0,1})       \\
           & = A \exp{(\frac{\beta \omega_{1,0}}{2})} \\
\end{align}
where
\(A =
\mathcal{C}_{1,0} \mathcal{C}_{0,1}
\sqrt{\pi}
\frac{64 k_f^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^3}{\beta e^4 m^2}\).
This gives a combined rate of
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 = 2A\cosh{(\frac{\beta (E_1 - E_0)}{2})}
  \label{eqn:theoretical rate lindblad equation}
\end{equation}
for an energy difference of
\(3.04\pm0.16\times{}10^{-21} J\)
(\cref{eqn:hydrogen energy difference})
we find a tunnelling rate of
\(6.1\times{}10^{8}s^{-1}\),
corresponding to a
tunnelling time of around
\(1.6\times{}10^{-9}s\).

  \caption{Plot of the Lindblad solution with a characteristic decay
  rate of \(6.1\times{}10^{9}s^{-1}\)}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Assessing the Rotating Wave approximation}
If we relax the rotating wave approximation
we arrive at the expression given in \cref{sec:redfield equation full solution}.
\begin{align}
  \bra{m}\dot{\hat{\rho{}}}(t) \ket{n} & = \begin{aligned}[t]
    \sum_{i,j} &
    \exp{(-i\Delta{}E_{n,j;m,i} t)}
    \Gamma_{n,j;m, i}(\omega_{m,i})
    \rho_{i,j}   \\
               &
    -\exp{(-i\Delta{}E_{i,m;i,j} t)}
    \Gamma_{i,m;i, j}(\omega_{i,j})
    \rho_{j, n}  \\
               &
    +\exp{(i\Delta{}E_{n,j;m,i} t)}
    \Gamma_{n,j; m, i}(\omega_{n,j})
    \rho_{i, j}  \\
               &
    -\exp{(i\Delta{}E_{i,j;i,n} t)}
    \Gamma_{i,j; i, n}(\omega_{i,j})
    \rho_{m, j}
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
This equation produces extra oscillations
on top of the Lindblad result, with
a characteristic timescales of
\(\frac{2\pi}{\omega_{1,0}} = 2.13\times{}10^{-13}s\). Plotting
the full solution (\cref{fig:redfield full solution})
however we see exactly the same behaviour as that
predicted by the lindblad result.

  equation. On short timescales

  at long timescales (\cref{fig:redfield full solution long timescales})
  the solution decays at the same rate as the
  Lindblad equation.}\label{fig:redfield full solution}

\subsection{Temperature Dependance}



\subsection{}

One issue with the \ldots approach is that it failed to
incorporate behaviour key to incoherent tunnelling.
In the simulation the tunnelling process was dominated by
transitions between two states with the same energy,
rather than two states with the same electron configuration.
To have any hope of recovering this behaviour we therefore need
to modify the approach to take this into account.


\subsection{Further Generalisations}
is that the density matrix of the system
is completely uncorrelated with the density
matrix of the surroundings. This contradicts
one of the key features seen in the simulation-
the tunnelling of hydrogen is accompanied by
an electron hopping to a lower energy
level. Decoupling the system and surroundings
is a hard problem in general, however if
we limit ourselves to
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_t = \sum_{m,n} \hat{\rho}_{m,n} \otimes {(\hat{\rho}_E)}_{m,n} \
\end{equation}
we can follow the same procedure as in
\cref{sec:the redfield assumption}
to arrive at the equation
\begin{equation}
  \bra{m}\dot{\hat{\rho}}(t)\ket{n} = \begin{aligned}[t]
    \sum_{i,j,k, l} &
    \exp{(-i(\omega_{i,j}-\omega_{k,l})t)}
    \Gamma^{m,n}_{i,j;k, l}(\omega_{k,l})
    [S_{k, l}{\hat{\rho}(t)}_{m,n},
    S^\dagger_{i,j}]  \\
    +               &
    \exp{(i(\omega_{i,j}-\omega_{k,l}))}
    {\Gamma^*}^{m,n}_{k, l; i,j}(\omega_{i,j})
    [S_{k, l},
        {\hat{\rho}(t)}_{m,n} S^\dagger_{i,j}]
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma^{m,n}_{i,j, k,l}(\omega) =
  \int_0^\infty{}{
  ds \exp{(i\omega{}s)}
  Tr_{E}[E^\dagger_{i,j}(t)E_{k,l}(t-s)
  {(\hat{\rho}_E)}_{m,n}]
  }
\end{equation}


TODO- How do we produced thematised and localised states??
we can do one but not both??
TODO- we want states to lie close to the fermi level after
perturbation
