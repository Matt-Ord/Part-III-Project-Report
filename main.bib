  abstract = {The diffusion of 1H and 2H on Ni(111) and (100) surfaces of a field emitter was studied by the fluctuation method. Activated and tunneling diffusion was seen on both surfaces. On (111) the activation energy for diffusion of 1H, Ed(1H) ~ 3 kcal at low coverage, increases to ~ 4 kcal at higher coverage and then decreases slightly. Ed(2H) parallels Ed(1H) but is 0.4 kcal higher throughout D0(1H) = 3 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 at low coverage, rises to 7 × 10−2 cm2 s−1 at midcoverage and then drops only slightly different over most of the coverage range. Tunneling diffusion coefficients DT are ~ 10−10 cm2 s−1 for both isoto with only small coverage dependence over the accessible range. On (100) Ed(1H) = 3.2 kcal with very little coverage dependence, and Ed(2H) = 3.6 kcal, also with very little coverage dependence. D0(1H) = 8 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1 at low coverag constant with increasing coverage. D0(2H) = 2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 at low, and rises to 2 × 10−4 cm2 s−1DT(1H) = 10−12 cm2 s−1 at low coverage and only weakly coverage dependent. DT(2H) = 10−12 cm2 s−1 at low coverage. The small isotope effects in tunneling are attributed to relatively small barrier opacities and to some cancellation of mass effects in H tunneling and in the substrate distortions accompanying tunneling.}
